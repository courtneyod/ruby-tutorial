# Intro into Open Sourced Projects

This is my first time being exposed to an open source project, specifically's Women Who Code's website. The have their issues grouped by the type of problem and complexity, including beginner friendly issues.

The tutotorial goes over how to their environment up and running. They have a terrific wiki on their repo but I wanted to share how I set up it, issues I ran into and how I resolved them. I'm working off a fairly new computer that has Node installed and atom, but not much else so basically from scratch.
